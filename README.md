# 100 Days
## Summer 2023
---
This is the repository for my 100 Days of Making project for the Summer 2023 Session.

I will be choosing and drawing objects from 3 to 5 images contained in the COCO Dataset. The end
goal is to have ~ 350 - 500 examples of my drawings based on well segmented and annotated images. The
longer term goal will be to train a model to take an image and return a 'drawing' of an object or 
objects from it in my style.
